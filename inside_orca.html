			        <p>Only a select few make it to this chamber. Here we, the able men and women of Hyrule take extreme measures to do what is right for our King and country. </p>
			        <p>If you believe that the Hylians were chosen by the Godesses to rule this land, if you believe that we, the Hylians, are best suited to bring peace, plenty, and happiness to all the inhabitants of Hyrule, whether human or not, then you stand with us. If you believe that we must use force and not hesitate to do something that may not seem right in the moment, for the cause of the greater good, then you are ready. If you are tired of seeing good men and women killed for just trying to do good across a difficult and unforgiving land, then maybe you have the determination to do what is right.</p>
			       <p>If you are in fact ready to join us then take the oath below. You will swear with your life that you will work with us to do what is right for Hyrule. If you take this oath, there is no turning back. You will begin training to be one of the elite. Only the most staunch of Hylian patriots need bother.</p>
			       <p>So if you love The Goddesses and are ready to lay down your life if needed to protect them and Their sacred will, join us.</p>
