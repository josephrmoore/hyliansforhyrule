		        	</h1>
		        	<p>Does that sound insensitive? Maybe, but that's just the way it is. When the Godesses created this world they left it in the care and charge of their chosen people, the Hylian. We are the Hylians, and we will not be forced off our land or cowed by bullies who only wish to see our destruction.</p>
		        	<p>These are our articles of faith, the tenets which we live, fight, and rule.</p>
		        	<ul class="heart-list">
		        		<li>
		        		The 3 Goddesses, Aruyu, Din, and Farore, the ones who created this world in Their own limitless wisdom courage and power, are the only true Gods of this world, and any who do not believe should not be allowed to live here in the Golden Lands that They made for us.
		        		</li>
		        		<li>
			        	We recognize the Goddess-given right of us, the Hylians, to hold dominion over the land and all those who live in it, as the Goddesses created only us in their own image.
			        	</li>
		        		<li>
			        	We will fight for our right to preserve this dominion, even to the death, in order to maintain our rightful given place as the only true rulers of this land. It is a sacred duty to the Goddesses themselves that we do this, and not just for our own elevation.
			        	</li>
		        	</ul>
		        </div>
		        
		        <div class="why-we-fight">
			        <h1>It's Dangerous to Go Alone</h1>
			        <p>The overworld is dangerous and full of monsters of all shapes sizes and colors. Only through Hylian settlements in the most fertile regions of the world have been able to stem the growth and power of these dangerous beasts. But even though the world we live in now is much safer than that of our fathers, it is still full of creatures and races who only live to see our destruction. And while there is no of us losing our settlements as a whole, we as Hylians, remain targets when we travel with many creatures actively seeking us out and trying to destroy us.</p>
			        <p>This is why we fight! The world is a deadly place and it's dangerous to go alone. By leaning on each other, keeping ourselves educated, and actively working to aid and protect the Hylian military, whether by service or just giving a bottle of milk to a passing soldier in The Town, we hold each other up, keep each other standing, and keep the world Hylian the way The Godesses meant it to be.</p>
		        </div>
		        
		        <div class="what-we-do">
		        	<h1>Take the Battle to the Enemy!</h1>
		        	<p>So what can we do about it? We will fight! We will die, if necessary, but until we do we will slash with every heart left in our bodies to take the fight to the enemy instead of fighting them at home. Proud Hylian warriors, in the tradition of the Great Hero of Time, battle through every corner of the land, rooting out insurgents and violent dissidents no matter what race tribe or kingdom they come from. By extending the One True King's Peace to the other indigenous regions we will be creating a world we can all live in free of fear of antihyliac hate and prejudice.</p>
		        </div>
		        
		        <div class="how-to-help">
		        	<h1>Master Using It And <br />You Can Have This</h1>
		        	<p>There's no time to waste! Pick up a sword and join the fight today. Hylian recuiting outposts in Kakariko Village, Clock Town, and Gerudo Valley are accepting volunteers to the Hylian army, as well as enrolling all eligible men recnetly come-of-age to do their mandatory patriotic duty by giving a few small years in the service of a truly Hylian Hyrule.</p>
		        	<p>But not everyone has the courage of the Hero of Time or the Strength of Ganondorf, if your side of the Triforce leans more heavily on Wisdom, you can join the fight right here. Participate in Hylian Clicktivist activities and Social Media outreach programs. You can see some of the great work we've been doing <a href="clicktivism.html">here</a>. We also have great resource on how you can organize events in person in your village to help gain more support for the Hylian cause. No matter what your strengths, if you care about Hyrule and want to see it become the Golden Land it was always meant to be, you will be an essential part of the fight to create the Hyrule for Hylians we all want to live in.</p>

		        	<h1>They Want Us to Quit, <br />But We Will Continue</h1>
		        	<p>The antihyliac agenda continues to drum up support on social media gathering posts throughout Hyrule. Here's one particularly virulent exchange between a Deku Scrub and a young Zora denigrating the brave young men giving all in the service of our great kingdom, and even the Great Hero of Time himself, Goddesses Bless Him. </p>

		        	<p>These attitudes are dangerous, poisonous, and contagious. Every post where someone has taken the time to write lies about us and our cause, every slander and attempt to re-write history is another sword raised against our people. It starts with words sure, but words quickly become feelings which always become action.</p>
		        	<p>So how to you fight antihyliac propaganda like this? Speak up! Don't stay silent! Let your friends and family know that you support the Hylian Military Effort, through words, hearts, and deeds.
