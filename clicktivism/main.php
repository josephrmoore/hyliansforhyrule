		        	<p>Not all battles are fought with swords and armor, sometimes just living what you believe can be enough to take the battle to the enemy. Hyrulians (People who believe in the Hylian right to live in Hyrule) have been helping us to make the world safer through their tireless efforts for decades but now you don't even have to get off the couch to make a difference.</p>

		        	<p>The antihyliac agenda continues to drum up support on social media gathering posts throughout Hyrule. Here's one particularly virulent exchange between a Deku Scrub and a young Zora denigrating the brave young men giving all in the service of our great kingdom, and even the Great Hero of Time himself, Goddesses Bless Him. </p>

		        	<p>These attitudes are dangerous, poisonous, and contagious. Every post where someone has taken the time to write lies about us and our cause, every slander and attempt to re-write history is another sword raised against our people. It starts with words sure, but words quickly become feelings which always become action.</p>
		        	<p>So how to you fight antihyliac propaganda like this? Speak up! Don't stay silent! Let your friends and family know that you support the Hylian Military Effort, through words, hearts, and deeds. Take on the antihyliac hate all too prevalent in the overworld.</p>
